Tetris AI app that can train a Tetris bot that can outperform the vast majority of Competitive Tetris Players using a Genetic Learning Algorithm Model built in C++ that can evaluate the best possible next moves, taking into account at most 4 (at depth=2) future pieces at once.

**[  APP FEATURES  ]**
  
-> You start off with you own **personal bot** that has a **randomized evaulation system**
  
-> There is also a **pre-built bot** that has a **set evaulation system** that I have personally obtained by training the same bot that you start off with for a long period of time.
  
-> You can choose to **battle** against either your **personal bot** or the **pre-built bot**, or you can choose to have the **two AI bots challenge each other**
  
-> You can **train** your own bot using **different training enviornments** that can alter the behaviour that your personal bot will learn
      
      -> Modes: 1 vs 1, highest score wins, last to survive 
  
-> There is a **settings** menu to alter certain game options


**[  REQUIRMENTS  ]**

    -> MinGW installed and set in your global PATH variables
    -> All else included in installation folder
